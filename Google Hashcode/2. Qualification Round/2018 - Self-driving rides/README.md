#### Introduction

> Millions of people commute by car every day; for example, to school or to their workplace.
>
> Self-driving vehicles are an exciting development for transportation.
> They aim to make traveling by car safer and more available while also saving commuters time.
>
> In this competition problem, weâ€™ll be looking at how a fleet of self-driving vehicles can efficiently get commuters to their destinations in a simulated city.

#### Task

> Given a list of pre-booked rides in a city and a fleet of self-driving vehicles,
> assign the rides to vehicles, so that riders get to their destinations on time.
>
> For every ride that finishes on time (or early), you will earn points
> proportional to the distance of that ride;
> plus an additional bonus if the ride also started precisely on time.
